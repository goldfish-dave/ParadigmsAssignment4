Installing Graph-Easy:
=====================
goto 
	http://linuxgazette.net/139/okopnik.html

This page is about installing perl modules as non-root user. Only follow the
instructions down until the end of "Configuring the Environment". You can us
e a location other than myperl if you want (I used .perllibs).

Once you've done that install the Graph-Easy-0.70.tar.gz from
	http://search.cpan.org/~shlomif/Graph-Easy/bin/graph-easy

extract using
	$ tar -xzf Graph-Easy-x.xx.tar.gz

Instead of properly installing we'll just copy 
	Graph-Easy/bin/graph-easy
into
	~/bin/.
or somewhere else accessible from your PATH (alternatively you can add it to
the .gitignore file and leave it in this directory).

Also copy 
	Graph-Easy/lib/Graph
(and all of it's contents) into
	the location you added to PERL5Lib previously.

You should be able to test graph easy with this:
	$ echo "[ Bonn ] - car -> [ Berlin ]" | graph-easy

If it doesn't work, and the error message isn't obvious, try going through 
all the steps you can on the first linked page, and run
	$ perl Makefile.PL
in the Graph-Easy directory.
